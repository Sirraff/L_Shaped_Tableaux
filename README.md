# Young Tableaux Generator
This program generates all Young tableaux with the specified height and number of remaining columns, 
and displays them in a GUI using tkinter. 
A Young tableau is a way of representing a partition of a positive integer by arranging its parts
in a two-dimensional array so that the parts are weakly increasing along each row and strictly increasing down each column.

### Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- tkinter
~~- Pillow~~
